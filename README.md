## MultiTool
MultiTool is an interactive multi-purpose bioinformatic tool that enables researchers with no background in bioinformatics to complete common tasks in the ever-growing field of '-omics'.

How it operates:

    $ ./MultiTool.sh 
    1) Extract         4) ReadQuality    7) BaseCounter   10) ToolBox
    2) GeneCopies      5) ReadFilter     8) SNPCalling    11) Help
    3) FindGene        6) ProteomeSize   9) MutationLoad  12) Quit
    Enter your choice (use number):
The user can navigate through a series of curated options without the need of complex pipelines.
    
## Thermodynamic Promoter Activity Predictor (TPAP) 
TPAP is a DNA-protein binding prediction model for RNA Polymerase-promoter association that takes into consideration the thermodynamic principles behind TF-promoter binding events. It uses a supervised, binary Steiner tree model to predict changes in promoter activity when TF binding regions of a promoter are mutated or completely inhibited.
